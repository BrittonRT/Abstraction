To install Abstraction on a webserver, your server must meet the following requirements:
	Apache Webserver
	PHP

USING FTP	
	
1. Use an FTP program (such as FileZilla - http://filezilla-project.org/) to upload the builder directory to your server. Place it in the directory your home page will appear, or in any directory you want to access and edit.

2. Go to the builder's url. (e.g. www.YourWebsite.com/builder)

3. Create a username and password. This will log you in to the builder. 

4. That's it.
